Solutions - API based data provision (A websocket would eliminate the need for the solutions below):
    -   When there's a connection error during a prices' data update, the previous prices' data update session time,
        if any, will be updated to prevent immediate API access. Hence, ensuring that the app does not exceed the
        current API credit limit - 55 credits per minute.
    -   Where prices are partially retrieved, a previous price data map, if any, will be updated and served.
        If none exists, a temporary map will be created and served

Verdict: A web socket, which costs too much for this demo would greatly reduce the need for ingenuity,
         and the need to come up with creative ways to walk around the limitations of the current
         API limit - 55 credits per minute..
